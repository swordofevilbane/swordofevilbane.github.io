   date="2014 – present (expected 2019)"
   location="McMaster University | Hamilton, ON"
%}

## Research Experience
The Integrated Science program involves the learning of science through team-based, interdisciplinary research projects.  Thus far I have conducted twelve group research projects and three independent research projects. The most relevant of these research projects are outlined below:

{% include cv-item.html
    title="Independent Project"
    date="January – April 2017"
    content="
- Completed work on organic synthesis research with my project consultant Dr. Alex Adronov in the Chemistry Department, under the supervision of a graduate student
- I performed a 4-step synthesis of an azide containing pillar[5]arene conjugate, and this conjugate then underwent strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) with a bibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) containing polyimine polymer
- The pillar clicked polymer was suspended onto carbon nanotubes to create a network that integrated the sensing abilities of pillararenes through host-guest chemistry, as well as the signalling abilities of carbon nanotubes through resistivity measurements
- If successful, this proof-of-concept study will lead to more selective, portable, and robust chemical sensors
- I submitted a 20 page research paper, and a 10 minute presentation was delivered at the Synthesis Symposium hosted by the Integrated Science program and held at McMaster University

    title="Climate Change"
    date="November 2016"
    content="
- With a group of four colleagues, a 20 minute audio podcast episode was created in order to effectively communicate climate change concepts and issues in a captivating manner to a target audience that is aware of climate change issues, but not extensively educated in science
- Throughout the course of this project emphasis was put on keeping a thorough and organized research notebook both individually and as a group
- My specific role in this project was to research and choose what I saw fit as a plausible short-term technique for solar radiation management as well as a long-term solution for carbon dioxide removal. Our group desired to educate the audience on current advancements in climate engineering and how they could be implemented

    title="Enrichment Project"
    date="February 2016"
    content="
- Individual project done with my consultant Dr. Randall Dumont in the Chemistry Department
- Used thermochemistry to explain and understand the dynamics of black holes; specifically what happens to the entropy and enthalpy in a binary black hole system
- I delivered a research paper using the literature, and I modified relevant equations to provide a thorough understanding of the evolution and ultimate fate of two black holes spiralling in towards each other using both theoretical models and actual observational data

    title="Neuroscience"
    date="October 2015"
    content="
- With a group of five colleagues, a course outline was created for one term of the high school year. My group decided to create the grade 12 biology curriculum, and specifically focus on teaching neuroepigenetics. We concentrated on describing the general field and history, as well as diseases and treatment options
- A detailed course syllabus was created, printed, and presented at a poster presentation to faculty and students associated with the Integrated Science Program, as well as a hands-on activity to help with the understanding of the histone octamers

    title="Plant-Animal Interactions"
    date="September 2015"
    content="
- Conducted in a group of five colleagues
- The project was centered around having standard experimental equipment at our disposal, and we designed our own experiment in the laboratory to study plant-animal interactions
- We studied the effects of increasing doses of nicotine treated Arabidopsis thaliana on adult aphids to see if the aphids would detect the health of the plants and migrate respectively using a series of “bridges” we constructed
- My group and I pitched a 10 minute presentation to the project leads, and a research paper was delivered

    title="Sustainable Energy"
    date="February 2015"
    content="
- Conducted in a group of five colleagues
- The focus of this research project was understanding how the main sustainable energy resources operated, and what types of climate each work best in, in terms of efficiency
- My individual role was to convey how and why my group and I determined geothermal energy to be the most efficient renewable energy source for Vancouver, Canada
- My group and I pitched a 10 minute presentation to the faculty and students associated with the Integrated Science Program at McMaster University, and a research paper was delivered
" %}

    title="Drugs, Doses and Biodistribution"
    date="November 2014"
    content="
- Conducted in a group of five colleagues
- Research was centred on drug addiction and the physiological and environmental effects of drugs
- I researched implementations that could be added to rehabilitation centres in order to improve treatment, and I also studied the effects of a potential drug plant spill of oestrogen in Toronto, Ontario
- My group and I pitched a presentation to faculty and students associated with the Integrated Science Program at McMaster University, and a research paper was delivered
